Mr President we asked our wiewers if they have questions, here are a couple, Jamie T. from Virginia said :
One of your biggest messages and campaign slogans was "drain teh swamp." With the idea that serving the American people is a privilege and not a career.
And that politicians are supposed to answer to the American people and not the opposite: When will your administration be putting together a proposal for term limits for Congress ?
